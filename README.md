Living-Water-System

Open-source conceptual framework using wave, air, and gravity interplay for seawater lifting and desalination.

⸻

Overview

The Living-Water-System is a self-sustaining environmental energy framework that converts natural wave motion into stored potential energy and compressed air.
It uses the cyclic motion of the ocean—wave, air, and gravity—to elevate, compress, and distribute water in a closed natural rhythm.

This repository documents the full open-source concept, including engineering rationale, biomimetic material design, and references for public replication or adaptation.

System Architecture

Stage 1 – Wave Elevator

Principle: Ocean wave oscillations create alternating positive and negative pressure phases.
Mechanism:
	•	As the wave crest rises, it exerts + pressure, pushing water upward.
	•	As the trough falls, it creates − pressure, pulling water upward again.
This continuous push-pull lifts water incrementally through a column (the “water elevator”), converting wave kinetic energy → gravitational potential energy stored in an elevated reservoir.

Stage 2 – Trompe Protocol

Principle: Falling water entrains air, compressing it naturally under hydrostatic pressure.
Mechanism:
	•	Elevated water from Stage 1 descends through a vertical shaft.
	•	Air mixed with the falling water separates under pressure and accumulates in a chamber, producing compressed air potential energy.
Output: The pressurized air can power pump stations or drive desalination processes.

Stage 3 – Gastropod Pipe

Principle: Biomimicry of the barb-footed gastropod, an organism that forms an iron shell in geothermal vents.
Design:
	•	Outer shell: ductile iron
	•	Core: vitrified clay, ceramic-lined
Fabrication Sequence:

	1.	Form clay pipe and vitrify.
	2.	While hot, place within a vertical mold.
	3.	Pour molten ductile iron around it, bonding metal and ceramic under thermal equilibrium.
This creates a corrosion-resistant, high-pressure conduit suitable for seawater and air systems.
