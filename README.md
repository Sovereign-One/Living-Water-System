# Living-Water-System
Open source conceptual framework using wave, air, and gravity interplay for seawater lifting and desalination.

The Living Water System





An open-source concept for a self-sustaining, wave-driven water elevation and desalination network.

This repository holds the public, educational descriptions of the idea so that anyone can study or adapt it.








Files





1. The Living Water System – Technical White Paper.docx

Outlines the physics and component relationships in ratio form.



2. The Living Water System – Engineer’s Journal.docx

Narrative development notes, reasoning, and material philosophy.

Intent





This work is offered as an idea gift—a platform for exploration, not a product.

It belongs to everyone and may be reinterpreted freely within the bounds of open-source licensing.








Quick Start for Publication





Place all four files in one folder named Living_Water_System_Open_Source.
Upload that folder to your public GitHub repository.
In the repository description, write:
“Open-source conceptual framework for a self-feeding wave–air–water system, released under CERN-OHL-P-2.0 and CC-BY-4.0.”
Commit the files. Your timestamped public release is complete.
